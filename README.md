# My Personal Project

## Travel Destination Application

This application will allow users to:
- As a user, I want to add a city that I have visited
- As a user, I want to view the cities in my collection
- As a user, I want to rate the cities in my collection on a scale of one to five stars
- As a user, I want to write a short note about the cities in my collection
- As a user, I want to view the cities by their continent
- - As a user, I want to view the cities by their ratings

This project is of interest to me because I often see destinations on Instagram that I want to travel to, and I want to
have a repository of these locations to refer to when I plan my vacation. While I can save the post that comes up on 
the Feed or on Reels, currently it can't be done on Stories. Furthermore, when I refer back to it, it's not quite
convenient as there are no additional grouping or note adding functionalities, and you'll have to manually go through
each picture's captions to know where the location is. Lastly, I think it would be convenient to have a central 
repository of all the destinations I have travelled to and a rating function, so that years later when a friend
asks me about my experience at a certain location, I won't risk forgetting the name and the details of my experiences.
