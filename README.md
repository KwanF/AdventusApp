# My Personal Project

## Travel Destination Application

This application will allow users to:

- As a user, I want to add a city that I have visited to my collection
- As a user, for each city added, I also want to assign a rating from 1-5 star, and as well as its continent
- As a user, I want to view all the cities in my collection
- As a user, I want to view the cities by their continent
- As a user, I want to view the cities by their ratings
- As a user, I want to remove a city
- As a user, I want to be able to save my travel destination list to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my travel destination from file (if I so choose)

This project is of interest to me because I think it would be convenient to have a central 
repository of all the destinations I have travelled to and a rating function, so that years later when a friend
asks me about my experience at a certain location, I won't forget the name and the details of my experiences.
